  A Helm chart for deploying Poiesis – a GA4GH TES-compliant Task Execution Service
  (TES) designed for Kubernetes. Poiesis enables scalable, secure, and user-friendly
  orchestration of high-throughput computational workflows.

  Built with the needs of modern bioinformatics in mind, Poiesis makes it easier to run
  complex genomics analyses involving tens of thousands of distributed compute tasks.

  This implementation adheres to the GA4GH TES specification, promoting interoperability
  and cross-institutional research by standardizing task execution across different
  compute backends.
